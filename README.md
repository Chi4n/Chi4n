<h3 > Hi there! I'm Gian Franco Baeza</h3>

---
✨ I'm a frontend developer with a passion for making the web accessible to everyone. I am studying to become a full stack developer, and to be able to have both frontend and backend development focuses.

I love sharing my knowledge with others, working in a group and above all I prioritize the good relationship between my colleagues.
I really want to progress in this world and I am very excited to continue learning and continue studying this profession.
